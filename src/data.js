        description: "Meditations by Marcus Aurelius is a timeless collection of philosophical reflections written by the Roman emperor during his rule in the 2nd century AD. Rooted in Stoic philosophy, these personal writings offer wisdom on self-discipline, virtue, duty, and resilience. Aurelius contemplates the nature of life, the importance of inner peace, and the value of living in harmony with the universe. Despite being written nearly two thousand years ago, the meditations remain strikingly relevant for modern readers seeking guidance in a chaotic world. Honest, humble, and deeply introspective, this book is not just a guide for leaders but for anyone striving to live a more thoughtful, purposeful life. A profound and meditative masterpiece of ancient thought.",

        prix : 1900,
        description: "The Stranger, written by Nobel Prize-winning author Albert Camus, is a powerful exploration of absurdism and existential philosophy. The novel follows Meursault, an emotionally detached French Algerian who is indifferent to social norms and morality. After committing a seemingly senseless murder, he is put on trial, not just for his crime, but for his lack of emotional conformity. Through Meursault's passive and indifferent perspective, Camus challenges the expectations of society and the meaning of life itself. Stark, thought-provoking, and deeply philosophical, The Stranger is a cornerstone of 20th-century literature and a profound reflection on the absurdity of existence.",
